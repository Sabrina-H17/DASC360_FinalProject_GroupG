Add Headers to each section, for example add a header to initial findings, this can include changes needed for the data, interpreting the data using 1 or 2 Dimensional graphs, etc
Add summaries to each header for easier readability and overall cleaness to the document
When interpreting data using graphs, explain why we use the graph of choice, does it fit the specific data set that we are visualizing?

Tip- You can go to RStudio and go to Project-> "report format" and edit the format of the document to fit the project report formatting
